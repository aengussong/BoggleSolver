# BoggleSolver
Find all words for the [Boggle game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle) provided dictionary and boggle board. Current implementation uses DFS to find all valid words on the board and 26-way trie to validate words and to store the dictionary.

Current implementation uses internaly algs4 library, so it should be compiled via `javac -cp .;algs4.jar BoggleSolver.java`.
